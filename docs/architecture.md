# Hyperlogica Architecture: ACEP-Based Vector Reasoning

## Overview

Hyperlogica is a vector-based reasoning system that implements the AI Conceptual Exchange Protocol (ACEP) using hyperdimensional computing principles. The system processes structured ACEP representations directly, generating vector embeddings for reasoning, and produces human-readable explanations of the reasoning process.

This document outlines the architecture of the Hyperlogica system with a focus on ACEP-based inputs and vector reasoning.

## Core Components

### 1. Input Processing

The system accepts ACEP-formatted data directly as input, with structured representation of:

- **Rules**: Conditional relations with explicit condition and implication components
- **Facts**: Factual assertions with structured content and attributes
- **Entities**: Groups of related facts with metadata

Input data is parsed from JSON configuration files, which include processing parameters, persistence options, and output schema specifications.

### 2. Vector Generation

Vectors are automatically generated from ACEP representations through a deterministic process:

- **Concept Vectors**: Generated from structured concept representations
- **Role Binding**: Concepts are bound with role vectors (condition, implication)
- **Rule Vectors**: Created by binding and bundling condition and implication components
- **Fact Vectors**: Generated from structured fact content

The vector generation preserves semantic relationships, enabling meaningful similarity measurements during reasoning.

### 3. Vector Operations

The system implements core hyperdimensional computing operations:

- **Binding (âŠ•)**: Combines vectors to create associations (typically using XOR for binary vectors)
- **Unbinding**: Extracts components from bound vectors
- **Bundling (+)**: Creates superpositions of multiple vectors
- **Normalization**: Ensures vectors maintain consistent properties

These operations enable complex reasoning with explicit certainty propagation.

### 4. Reasoning Engine

The reasoning engine applies vector-based inference to derive conclusions:

- **Pattern Matching**: Matches facts to rule conditions using vector similarity
- **Inference Rules**: Applies modus ponens, conjunction introduction, and other logical patterns
- **Certainty Propagation**: Propagates certainty values through reasoning chains
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Builds reasoning chains up to configurable depth

Multiple reasoning approaches are supported (weighted, Bayesian, majority).

### 5. Natural Language Generation

While accepting ACEP input directly, the system converts reasoning results to natural language:

- **ACEP-to-English Conversion**: Converts ACEP conclusions to human-readable text
- **Explanation Generation**: Creates natural language explanations of reasoning chains
- **Customizable Output**: Formats output according to domain-specific schema

This component leverages LLMs to generate high-quality explanations.

### 6. Persistence Layer

The system supports state persistence across sessions:

- **Vector Store**: Efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vectors
- **State Management**: Preserves context and reasoning chains
- **Result Serialization**: Exports results in configurable formats

## Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**:
   - Parse ACEP input configuration
   - Extract processing parameters
   - Initialize vector store and state

2. **Vector Generation**:
   - Generate vectors for all ACEP rules
   - Generate vectors for all ACEP facts
   - Store vectors in the vector store

3. **Reasoning**:
   - For each entity:
     - Match facts against rule conditions using vector similarity
     - Apply inference rules to derive conclusions
     - Build reasoning chains and track certainty
     - Determine final outcomes

4. **Output Generation**:
   - Convert ACEP conclusions to natural language
   - Generate explanations of reasoning processes
   - Format according to output schema
   - Save results to specified location

## ACEP Representation

{
  "identifier": "rule_example",
  "type": "conditional_relation",
  "content": {
    "condition": {
      "concept": "example_concept",
      "relation": "example_relation",
      "reference": "example_reference"
    },
    "implication": {
      "concept": "result_concept",
      "state": "result_state"
    }
  },
  "attributes": {
    "certainty": 0.8,
    "domain": "example_domain",
    "source": "example_source"
  },
  "binding": {
    "operation": "conditional_binding",
    "parameters": {
      "binding_strength": 0.9
    }
  }
}
```

### Fact Format

```json
{
  "identifier": "fact_example",
  "type": "factual_assertion",
  "content": {
    "concept": "example_concept",
    "relation": "example_relation",
    "reference": "example_reference",
    "actual_value": 123.4,
    "reference_value": 100.0
  },
  "attributes": {
    "certainty": 0.95,
    "source": "example_source",
    "timestamp": "yyyy-mm-dd"
  }
}
```

## Vector Generation Process

1. **Concept Vector Generation**:
   - Convert structured concept representation to a deterministic string
   - Use hash of string to seed random generator
   - Generate vector of specified dimension and type

2. **Role Vector Generation**:
   - Generate unique vectors for roles (condition, implication)
   - Ensure approximate orthogonality between role vectors

3. **Rule Vector Generation**:
   - Generate vectors for condition and implication components
   - Bind components with their respective roles
   - Bundle role-bound vectors to create the rule vector

4. **Fact Vector Generation**:
   - Generate vector from structured fact content
   - Ensure semantic alignment with rule conditions

## Reasoning Approaches

### 1. Vector-Weighted Approach

- Weights evidence based on vector similarity and certainty
- Calculates weighted sum for decision making
- Provides nuanced reasoning with certainty qualification

### 2. Bayesian Approach

- Updates probabilistic beliefs based on new evidence
- Uses Bayes' rule for mathematical rigor
- Handles complex interdependencies between evidence

### 3. Vector-Chain Approach

- Constructs explicit reasoning chains
- Preserves intermediate conclusions
- Enables explanation of multi-step reasoning

## Benefits

1. **Precision**: ACEP representation provides precise concept encoding
2. **Efficiency**: Direct ACEP processing eliminates translation overhead
3. **Transparency**: Explicit reasoning chains with certainty values
4. **Flexibility**: Multiple reasoning approaches for different domains
5. **Explainability**: Natural language explanations of reasoning processes

## Integration Points

1. **Input Integration**: Submit ACEP-formatted JSON configuration
2. **Vector Generation**: Optional external vector generation utility
3. **Result Consumption**: Access structured results or natural language explanations
4. **State Persistence**: Save and load reasoning state across sessions

## Example Usage

```python
from hyperlogica import process_input_file

# Process ACEP input configuration
results = process_input_file(
    input_path="acep_input_example.json",
    options={"verbose": True}
)

# Access results
for result in results["results"]:
    print(f"{result['entity_id']}: {result['outcome']} ({result['certainty']:.2f} confidence)")
    
    # Access explanation
    explanation = result["reasoning"]["explanation"]
    print(f"Explanation: {explanation}")
```

## Technical Requirements

## Conclusion

Hyperlogica provides a powerful framework for vector-based reasoning using ACEP representations. By accepting structured ACEP data directly and generating vector representations automatically, the system eliminates the need for language translation while maintaining the ability to produce human-readable explanations of the reasoning process.

This architecture enables efficient AI-to-AI communication with the precision of vector reasoning and the interpretability of natural language explanations.
